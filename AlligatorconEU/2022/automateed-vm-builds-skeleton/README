# Automated VM builds

This skeleton was created for my talk at AlligatorCon Europe 2022. It demonstrates how to automatically build a ready-to-use Kali VM using an azure pipline and packer. I hope it helps :).

## Requirements
- [packer](https://github.com/hasicorp/packer)
- VMWare Workstation

## Portability
You can easily substitute the azure pipeline with whatever you want (Gitlab CI, cronjob, etc.) as long as it can call packer.
inside the packer config file you can also change the builder to whatever you fancy, as long as packer supports it (e.g. Qemu, VitrualBox, AWS AMI, etc.). Have a look at packers [documentation](https://www.packer.io/plugins).
If packer does not yet support the VM environment you like, feel free to [implement it](https://www.github.com/hashicorp/packer) as packer is fully open source.
